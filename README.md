# Sparks-Bank
This website is made by Mohit Pansare @panzzzzz-er as answer to the Task1 of the Web Development internship at the Sparks Foundation.
The website lets a bank user to view all the customers of the bank and lets them transfer money between the accounts.
I have used HTML, CSS, JS and PHP for making the website. Thanks to TemplateMo for the website template.
For the server and database, I have used XAMPP, a service that provides a one stop solution for the server and database needs. The database language that I have used here is MySQL.
